All TrustMark builders must: Have a minimum three year trading history. Have their work inspected by an independent assessor every 3 years. All new members are inspected prior to their membership acceptance by the NRWB. This is the only scheme in the UK that inspects building companies in this way. Builders who wish to join the scheme have to provide 6 client references including a professional reference from which at least 3 are confirmed by the Federation of Master Builders Membership Department. Have passed independent financial checks. Have met with local FMB Branch approval. Have public and employer liability insurance. Have no un-discharged bankruptcies or relevant and outstanding County Court Judgments against company directors at the time of application. Are VAT registered if applicable. Have passed credit checks, public record and director checks. Have confirmed their commitment to the Federation of Master Builders and Trustmark’s Code of Practice. LJC (SW) Construction can offer a 2, 6, or 10 year insurance backed FMB Masterbond Warranty. The cost is dependent on the job value as it is calculated on a percentage basis. We see the Masterbond Warranty as providing our clients with added peace of mind.</p>

            A Representation for construction craftsmen and SMEs in Brussels!</h1>
            <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">An increasing number of national regulations are little more than national adaptations of European legislation in the social, fiscal and standardisation domains, usually implemented without properly assessing their impact on SMEs or providing neither special arrangements nor SME specific support. Craftsmen and SMEs are unable to rigorously comply with a regulatory regime that has become too complex and is unsuited to the everyday facts of life. Those representing construction craftsmen in several European countries therefore joined forces and, in 1990, founded the EBC – European Builders' Confederation. Through its 19 member and partner organisations, EBC represents 2 million craft and SMEs employing 2.5 million workers. Via its permanent office in Brussels, EBC works in close collaboration with the European Union of Craftsmen and SMEs (UEAPME) and the Office of Craftsmen and SMEs for Standardisation (NORMAPME), organisations of which EBC is a member.</p>
