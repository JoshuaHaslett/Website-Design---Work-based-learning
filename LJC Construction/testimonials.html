We agreed a time scale and both signed a contract for the works we had agreed. When work on our site started I found his staff and any sub-contractors to be very polite and nothing was too much trouble.<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>

                <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><b><font color="blue">"</font></b>In all things, LJC has been open and fair regarding costs, particularly as our lists of adjustments grew. Final invoices reflected original estimates and the costs of all works were at all times totally transparent. We would recommend Richard and his team without hesitation.<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>

                <p class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"><b><font color="blue">"</font></b>Nothing was too much trouble for LJC Construction in the building of our new house. We have a shared access driveway and they were always able to keep everything tidy and out of the way. We hardly knew they were there. As for the final result – we were amazed at the quality and high level of finish. I would recommend them to anyone.<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>

This is the second house they have built for me and I am currently looking for another site – need I say more?<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>
