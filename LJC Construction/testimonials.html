We agreed a time scale and both signed a contract for the works we had agreed. When work on our site started I found his staff and any sub-contractors to be very polite and nothing was too much trouble.<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>

Final invoices reflected original estimates and the costs of all works were at all times totally transparent.

As for the final result – we were amazed at the quality and high level of finish. I would recommend them to anyone.<b><font color="blue">"</font></b></p>
